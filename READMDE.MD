# Shopping Cart

- This is my take on the "Shopping Cart" project from "The Odin Project" course, Javascript path, React chapter.

## The Objective

- To create a store page with a working shopping cart that the user can add/remove products and adjust quantities before checking-out.
- To fixate unit testing with react components.
- To fixate client routing.
