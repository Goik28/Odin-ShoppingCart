# Shopping Cart
* This is my take on the "Shopping Cart" project from "The Odin Project" course, Javascript path, React chapter.
## The Objective
* To create a store page with a working shopping cart that the user can add/remove products and adjust quantities before checking-out.
* To fixate unit testing with react components.
* To fixate client routing.
